# my_first_async_calculator.rs

This is a calculator that is implemented as a server with an async client. I wrote this as a practice project for another project where I wanted to have a similar request and response framework.

It uses rust nightly and features that are in a pull request that may or may not change. I had fun writing this and experimenting with the new futures in rust.
